                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>I am currently searching for my place in the software engineering world. I left my insurance
                        accounting job in late 2018 to pursue my dream of earning a computer science degree. I was
                        accepted to UCR's Bourns College of Engineering, and graduated 4 years later in June of 2022.
                        During that time, I worked with a wide variety of tools and technologies, and absorbed many
                        different software-related skill sets. I am comfortable programming in C, C++, python,
                        JavaScript, and Java. I have created websites, apps, games, and devices, and I thoroughly
                        enjoyed every step along the way.</p>
                    <p>College was a broad education, and so I decided to to deepen my
                better
                        understanding for the hiring process by enrolling in the General Assembly SEI bootcamp. This
                        program consisted of over 400 hours of class time, as well as homework and projects. My
                        instructors taught me and my cohort a well-chosen set of skills, and I'm eager to put them to
                        good use at a company whose mission resonates with me.</p>
                    <p>I pride myself on being someone who learns every day. I love mastering
                        new skills, and I love to
                        apply new knowledge. I particularly enjoy ChatGPT, and use it daily to understand new topics and
                        formulate better questions. I have also completed many tech-related courses on Udemy and
                        Coursera, and plan to continue doing so.</p>
                    <p>I have strong problem-solving and analytical skills, and am well
                        practiced at breaking down
                        larger problems into more manageable components. Check out my BlogFolio here for examples.</p>
                    <p>I also pride myself on being an excellent teammate. I know when to
                        lead and when to follow, when
                        to speak up and when to bite my tongue. I am affable, humorous, respectful, and flexible. I know
                        when to ask for more work, and when to declare that I may be in over my head. I don't hide my
                        mistakes, but rather use them as learning opportunities. I am eager to work alongside more
                        experienced programmers and tech workers, and look forward to receiving a chance to do so.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time, I like to spend time with my girlfriend, family, and
                        friends. Relax with my
                        grumpy black cat, and hike with my Husky/Golden mix. I build, fly, crash, and repair drones.
